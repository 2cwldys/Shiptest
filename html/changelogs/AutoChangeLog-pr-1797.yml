changes:
  - rscadd: Physical money has been reworked one central item, instead of several
      smaller denominations. This item has a variable icon based on the amount of
      money contained within.
  - tweak: The central galactic bank has declared that material coins no longer have
      a monetary value. You can no longer print money with a coin press, if you somehow
      find one.
  - tweak: Many money drops are now slightly randomized.
  - tweak: Some interactions that used holocurrency now use hard cash instead.
  - soundadd: Adds new sound effects for dropping and picking up bills and coins.
  - imageadd: Adds new physical cash sprites.
  - code_imp: Cash.dm has been moved up a directory out of the Stacks dir, on account
      of no longer being a stack subtype
