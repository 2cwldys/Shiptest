changes:
  - rscadd: THE BEST AND GOODEST TOOL (the world's shittiest item, designed to be
      admin spawned for memes).
  - rscadd: A spellbook for The Traps.
  - rscadd: A slightly better whetstone.
  - rscadd: The Slime Guardian, a support guardian optimized for healing, feeding
      slimes, and nourishing players.
  - tweak: new loot spawners for random stock parts and materials.
  - tweak: adjusts animorph spellbook wording.
  - tweak: changes wording on crisis stimpack to make what it does more clear. Reduces
      stimulants and adds slightly more healing.
  - tweak: Adds a reverse necropotence bolt. Allows hostile magicarp to have considerably
      more random spells.

      Also adds functionality for other cyborg spawners that can do the same.
  - balance: fireball spellbook recoil no longer hardgibs those who are unfortunate
      enough to read it second.
  - balance: slightly reduces cursed Katana's self-damage.
  - balance: boosts netheric portal enemy spawning logic, adds a few new drops.
  - balance: increases the cost of the Heavy Mining Kit. Doubles suits gained and
      adds some survival pods and deepcore drill spawners.

      a chest with 3 necropolis loot items and can once again drop their special loot.
  - balance: adds a planet atmos immune variant to wizard simplemobs, for netheric
      portals.
  - bugfix: fixes way too many tumors spawning. Like, wow.
  - bugfix: fixes netheric portals only spawning a single snow legion head, instead
      of the actual mob
  - bugfix: prevents infinite dwarf legion trophy stacking
  - bugfix: revises the shitcode I wrote for the syndie crusher to be slightly less
      awful
