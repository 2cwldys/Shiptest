changes:
  - rscadd: Balloon Alerts, which appear visually over a character's head and convey
      a short string of text before disappearing.
  - rscadd: Area Balloon alerts, the above but visible to anyone nearby.
  - tweak: Digging into terrain now displays a balloon alert and does not chat log,
      to prevent spam.
  - tweak: Guns now do not trigger their "x fires y!" message for the user unless
      shot at point-blank.
  - tweak: The Kinetic Accelerator now no longer logs a *click* in chat when fired
      while on cooldown.
  - tweak: Reagent containers now balloon alert instead of chat logging when their
      reagent transfer amount is changed. Their transfer amount can now also be found
      in their description.
